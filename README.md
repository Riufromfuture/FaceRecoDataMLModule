### Overview

- This repository contains data, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model codes for a face recognition system. The project aims to build a robust face recognition model using deep learning techniques.

## Face Recognition System

### Overview
- End-to-end face recognition model
- Detects, extracts, and encodes facial features
- Uses machine learning for face matching
- No real-time processing required
- Optional Flask-based web app

### Components
1. **Face Detection**
   - Haar Cascade Classifier (OpenCV)
   - Cropping detected faces for further processing
2. **Feature Extraction & Encoding**
   - Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction
   - Eigenfaces for dimensionality reduction
3. **Recognition Accuracy**
   - Train and evaluate using structured image datasets
   - Compare extracted features for identity verification

### Implementation Steps
1. **Preprocessing**
   - Convert images to a structured format
   - Resize images using OpenCV modules
2. **Face Detection**
   - Use Haar Cascade to detect faces
   - Crop and label detected faces
3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Apply PCA to extract Eigenfaces
   - Generate feature vectors for recognition
4. **Face Matching**
   - Train a machine learning model on extracted features
   - Save trained model for recognition tasks
5. **Evaluation**
   - Measure performance with accuracy metrics
   - Fine-tune model parameters for better recognition

### Trained Model
- The trained model is built using PCA and Eigenfaces
- It is saved for future predictions and can be loaded without retraining
- Performance evaluation includes accuracy, precision, and recall
- The model can be fine-tuned with additional training data

### Optional Web App
- Flask-based API for face recognition
- Deployment options include cloud platforms

### Conclusion
- Scalable face recognition system using PCA & Eigenfaces
- Can be extended for applications like gender classification, age prediction, and facial emotion recognition
